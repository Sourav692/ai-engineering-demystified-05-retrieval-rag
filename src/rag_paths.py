"""Depth-independent resource resolution for the RAG curriculum.

Why this exists
---------------
The canonical lessons in this repository must not depend on fragile ``../../``
paths or on which directory the kernel happened to start in. They must still be
able to reach the shared corpora under ``data/sample/`` and the few module
assets that live next to a single module.

This module reconciles the two: notebooks ask for a resource by name, and the
resolver finds it relative to the repository root regardless of notebook depth
or kernel working directory.

Usage
-----
    from rag_paths import repo_root, asset, ASSET_ROOTS

    repo_root()                    # -> Path to the repository root
    asset("Transformer.pdf")       # -> resolved Path, searched across roots
    asset("bella_vista.txt")

Bootstrapping from a notebook (the module is not an installed package)::

    import sys, pathlib
    p = pathlib.Path.cwd()
    while not (p / "src/rag_paths.py").is_file() and p != p.parent:
        p = p.parent
    sys.path.insert(0, str(p / "src"))

Note on module-name collisions
------------------------------
This module is deliberately named ``rag_paths`` rather than ``utils`` or
``helpers`` so it can never shadow, or be shadowed by, the repository's
installed ``helpers`` package or a module-local ``utils.py``.
